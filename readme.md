## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
I made a website for Cafe France and changed its idenidity a bit since they still does not have any website and I highlighted their Makati branch but since resources are limited I get my assets from google, unsplashed, and adobe stock.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project - create a website for a coffee shop
- Whats the purpose - to build our own functioning multi-page website
- What are key components - about the coffee shop, the menus of the shop, and a homepage that should be functioning
- What technology used and how it is used - I used tailwind.css for my codes and as the building blocks of my website.

### Key Components
<!-- TODO: List of Key Components -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
- MultiPage Website
- Navbar that is working and linking it
- Moving pictures as background

### Technology
<!-- TODO: List of Technology Used -->
![HTML]- (https://readymadeui.com/)
![CSS] -
![JavaScript] -

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
WD-ProjectName
└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
